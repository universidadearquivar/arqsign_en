# üíª Platform Overview

## Platform features

ArqSign is a platform for electronic signatures that operates as follows: the user uploads the document, selects the signatories, establishes the signatures, and sends it to those involved in the signing process. Users can access the sent and received documents for signature anytime, from anywhere, on any device ‚Äì be it a mobile phone, computer, or tablet ‚Äì without compromising data security and encryption.&#x20;

ArqSign features the implementation of an API (Application Programming Interface), allowing users to integrate their Electronic and Digital Document Signatures into their company's solutions. &#x20;

The primary functionality of the ArqSign platform is to offer users the ability to send, manage, and sign documents digitally, using electronic signatures or digital certificates.&#x20;

### User and Signatory &#x20;

A User is an individual who uses the ArqSign platform to send, track workflows, collect signatures, access, and manage documents. A user must be linked to an account, or when they also need to sign a document, they become a signatory.&#x20;

In the ArqSign platform, a user can have the following profiles:&#x20;

* **Document Sender:** A user without permission to access platform management functionalities. Their access is focused on sending and managing their documents.&#x20;
* **Global Administrator:** Users with permission to access all platform functionalities, including folder and user management.&#x20;

A Signatory is an individual or legal entity that participates in the signing process (signs a document). The signatory does not need to have an account on the ArqSign platform to sign a document.&#x20;

### Paid Plans&#x20;

&#x20;When you subscribe to an ArqSign plan, you will have access to a specific number of document submissions via email, depending on the chosen plan.&#x20;

To send workflows via email, it is necessary for the account to have available sending credits, as the ArqSign Platform itself handles the workflow transmission. If the allotted email submissions in the user's plan are exhausted, they can purchase additional sending credits by accessing the "Buy Credits" menu after logging into the platform.&#x20;

All paid plans have identical functionalities, with the only difference being the number of submissions in each package and the availability between annual and monthly plans.&#x20;

#### Billing for Paid Plans &#x20;

The billing basis for each plan is the service of sending one workflow for signature. A single workflow submission can include multiple files and signatures, yet only one submission from the plan will be deducted.&#x20;

For monthly plans, you pay a monthly fee when subscribing to the plan and can immediately start using the tool. The monthly fee will be automatically billed on the same day of the month as the initial purchase, unless you disable automatic renewal.&#x20;

For annual plans, there is an option to purchase with interest-free installment payments for up to 12 months on a credit card.&#x20;

#### Purchasing a Plan&#x20;

1. To acquire a plan, on the ArqSign website's homepage, click on "Plans and Prices" in the top menu. &#x20;
