# üìÅ Documents

In the "Documents" menu, all the documents from the user's account that have been completed are stored, meaning they have been either sent by the user or by any of the members associated with the account and have been signed by all the signatories involved in the signing process. In this menu, it is possible to manage the storage of these documents.&#x20;

Upon clicking on the menu, the root folder of the directory is displayed, where all the account documents will be hosted.

### Access to the Directory Root Folder&#x20;

Access to the root folder of the directory is granted to users who have been designated as global administrators in the Administration > Users menu. Access for other users with a document sender profile must be managed by group, meaning you need to create a User Group and grant access to the group. To do this, in the "Actions" column, click on "Edit Authorizations."
