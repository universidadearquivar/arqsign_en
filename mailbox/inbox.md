# ✉️ Inbox

In the Inbox, all documents in which the user participates in the signature process as a signatory are listed. &#x20;

The signatory of a signature process can also be the sender of the document, and in this case, the document will be displayed in both the Inbox and the Sent menu.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**Documents that have already expired, meaning their signing deadline has passed, will not be displayed in the Inbox.**</mark>
{% endhint %}
