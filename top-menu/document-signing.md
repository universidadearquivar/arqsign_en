# ✍️ Document Signing

&#x20;The electronic signing process can be carried out through two pathways.&#x20;

Access via the link from the notification received by email&#x20;

This occurs when the responsible party receives an email notification, indicating that the document needs to be signed and providing the link for document access.&#x20;

The user responsible for signing will receive an email notification containing the link to access the file. This email will also display the sender's name and the deadline for signing. If the recipient has set a personalized message, it will also be shown in this notification.&#x20;

By clicking on the link or providing the code, the user will be directed to the login screen. If the user already has an active account on the signing platform, they can choose to sign the document without logging in or enter their credentials to access.&#x20;

If the user does not have a registered account on the platform, they will be directed to the signing screen without having to provide credentials, but at the end of the process, a suggestion message will be displayed for them to create a free trial account.&#x20;

IMPORTANT: Creating a free trial account is not mandatory.&#x20;

Direct Access to ArqSign via Login&#x20;

This occurs when the person responsible for the signature directly accesses the platform and checks the list of documents pending signature.&#x20;

After logging into the account, the user should click on the menu "Inbox > Incoming Mailbox." To sign a document, click on the "Sign" button for the desired file.&#x20;
