# ✍️ Document Signing

The electronic signing process can be carried out through two pathways:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Access via the link from the notification received by email " %}
This occurs when the responsible party receives an email notification, indicating that the document needs to be signed and providing the link for document access.&#x20;

The user responsible for signing will receive an email notification containing the link to access the file. This email will also display the sender's name and the deadline for signing. If the recipient has set a personalized message, it will also be shown in this notification.&#x20;

By clicking on the link or providing the code, the user will be directed to the signing screen.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Direct Access to ArqSign via Login " %}
This occurs when the person responsible for the signature directly accesses the platform and checks the list of documents pending signature.&#x20;

After logging into the account, the user should click on the menu "Inbox > Incoming Mailbox." To sign a document, click on the "Sign" button for the desired file.&#x20;

## Signing a Document&#x20;

### Step 1 - Accessing the Document&#x20;

If the sender has set a security code for opening the document, the signatory will be asked to enter the code, which should have been received earlier via email, SMS or from the sender. If the code is not received, the user should click on "Did Not Receive the Code."&#x20;

The document will be displayed on the screen for signing. At the top of the screen, the sender's name, document name, navigation between pages, and zoom and full-screen viewing buttons will be presented.

Clicking on "Options," the signer will be able to perform the following actions:

**Signature Registration:** Used to download the record of signatures made on the document. The Signature Registration displays all information about the electronic signatures made, such as the names of signers, date and time of signature, location and IP from where it was done, data of the digital certificates used, etc. If the sender has set up that a QR Code should be generated in the Signature Log on the Advanced Settings screen of the document registration, this QR Code will be displayed here.

**View History:** Used to view information about the document and the history of events related to it. It is also possible to download the original files of the process before the signatures were completed.

**Refuse Signing:** Used when the signer does not wish to sign the document for any reason. In this case, they should provide a justification for the refusal and click on "Refuse Signing". By declining the signature, the document signing process will be automatically canceled for all parties involved, and it will appear with the status "Canceled" for the sender responsible for the document.

**Conclude Later:** Used to return and complete the signature at another time.

**File Download:** Used to download the document.

When signing the document, the system will automatically record the signer's acceptance of the "**Electronic Signature Agreement**."

To change the language of the document viewing screen, in the bottom right corner of the screen, choose between "English - USA", "Spanish - Spain", or "Portuguese - Brazil".

### Step 2 - Signatory Information and Attachments&#x20;

In the next step, if the signer has been requested to provide additional data, they should fill it in.

If the signer has also been requested to attach files, they should upload the requested documents in the "Attachments" field. After completing, the user should click on "Next."

### Step 3 - Signature Style&#x20;

The Signature Style is the visual representation of the user's signature. To complete the signing of a document, the user must choose how they will sign:

* **Default:** In this style, the user must provide their full name and choose the style (font) in which the text will be presented. To do this, they should click on "Style" and make the selection.

* **Drawing:** To sign with a drawing, the user should sign or initial using the mouse in the "Signature Drawing Area." To correct, they should click on the "Erase" icon.

* **Image:** If desired, the user can upload an image representing their signature.

To conclude, the signer should click on "Finish". If it was requested in the document that they sign as both an Individual and a Legal Entity, the same signature will be used for both situations.

They will be directed to the login screen. If they already have an active account on the signing platform, they can enter their credentials to access it. If they do not have a registered account on the platform, a message suggesting that they create a free trial account will be displayed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**Creating a free trial account is not mandatory.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Step 4 - Concluding the signing process

After the process is completed and all signatories have signed the document, all participants will receive an email or WhatsApp notification about the completion of the signing process. By clicking on the received link, it will be possible to view the signed document, the document's ID code, information about the digital certificates and electronic signatures used for signing, and the history of events related to the document, as well as information about the signatories.
