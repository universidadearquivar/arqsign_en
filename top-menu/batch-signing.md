# üñäÔ∏è Batch Signing

The batch signing process allows the user to sign multiple documents at once. Batch signing is only available to users with a registered account on the platform and who are authenticated. On this screen, up to 100 documents per page will be displayed, depending on the number of pending documents for signature.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Documents that require a security code are not listed for batch signing. To sign them, the user must access their Inbox and sign them individually.**</mark>

4\. If the use of a digital certificate is determined, and if not done yet, the user will be prompted to install the "ArqSign Digital Certificate" extension in the browser and the AppNative application - Desktop Module on their machine, necessary for the use of digital certificates. Once installed, all digital certificates installed on the machine and hosted in the ArqSign account will be displayed for the user to choose which one to use for the signature and enter the PIN code (if requested).&#x20;

5\. The signing process information and a counter of completed signatures will be displayed. This way, the user can monitor the signatures until all of them have been completed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">**INFORMATION:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Depending on the number of documents sent in bulk, the user can let the ArqSign application work in the background and continue with their routine activities. It is not necessary to monitor the execution of the signing process until completion, but it is necessary to keep the login active.</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}

6\. Upon completing the batch signing, a completion message is displayed to the user. Click "Close" to finish. The list of pending documents for signature will be updated, showing only the documents that need to be resent to the signatories.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**In case of failures during the signing process for one or more selected documents in the batch, the platform will conclude the signing of the documents that follow the standard, report information about those that were signed, report the encountered failures, and keep as pending those documents for which the signing could not be completed.**</mark>&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">**EXAMPLE:**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">Some reasons for possible failures include multiple users signing the document simultaneously, internet connection drop during the signing process, interrupted access, among others.</mark>&#x20;
