# ðŸ›’ Purchase Plan or Change Plan

The "Buy Now" or "Change Plan" buttons will be displayed for users who have a free trial account or for users with an expired or soon-to-expire paid plan. In this case, the user can choose to stay on the current plan or switch to another plan.&#x20;

The "Buy Now" button will be displayed for users with an expired plan subscription.&#x20;

The "Change Plan" button will be displayed for users with a paid plan subscription with an upcoming expiration date (30 days before the expiration of annual plans and 10 days before the expiration of monthly plans).

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">**If the user has selected the "Automatic Renewal" option in the Administration > Account > Billing and Usage > Plan and Consumption screen, the "Buy Now" button will not be displayed. This is because when the plan expires, the system will keep the user on the current plan and automatically renew the payment, using the billing information already existing in the user's profile.**</mark>

3. After making the purchase, the system will check if the provided email is associated with any free account. If not, the user will receive a notification to activate their account.
4. If the user's previous account is free, they will have the option to upgrade to a paid plan or create a new account, maintaining two separate accesses.
5. If the account is shared with other users, all users with a global administrator profile for the account will receive an email notification about the plan change or renewal.
