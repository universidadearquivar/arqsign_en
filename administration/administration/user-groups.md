# ðŸŸª User Groups

The purpose of the User Groups functionality is to group the user members of the account to define permissions in the Directories > Documents menu to which each group will have access. Access permissions to directories are assigned to groups, and each user account member is included in the group by the account owner or global administrators.&#x20;

On the main User Groups screen, the group's name and the date and time of group creation are displayed.&#x20;
